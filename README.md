# Making Games with PPB

Python and video games are both used independently to learn software
engineering, so Python game frameworks have an important role in the software
development space. Come learn how to make games in Python so you can level up,
too.

## Abstract

We all know Python is a great learning language and a lot of software engineers
got their start into software engineering by building or modding games. The
combination of these factors makes Python games an important keystone in our
community, even if very few of us end up making video games as a living.

In this talk, we’ll cover some high level concepts you’ll need to understand
games, like events, event loops, and state modeling. Then we’ll cover the
constraints and expectations of PursuedPyBear, Python’s newest game framework.
Then we’ll cover its extensibility features.

At the end, viewers should be prepared to make a game in PursuedPyBear and have
a selection of resources for how to improve their knowledge and skill set with
video games.
