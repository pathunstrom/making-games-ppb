- Transition: 
    - let's talk about the basics of game development
    - all of this comes with ppb
    - I feel context helps understanding
- Event loops
    - All games have at least one "infinite" loop
    - other names
        - render loops
        - game loops
        - simulation loops
    - All names point to what's happening:
        - note that the order is only moderately important
        - render
        - handle user input via events
        - update the simulation based on time
    - What are events
        - Update
        - Heartbeats
        - key presses
        - mouse motion
        - Message passing
    - Responding to events
        - handler form
        - parameters
- Rendering
    - Raster graphics
        - also called bitmap graphics
        - 2d pixel array
    - How ppb does it
        - image/resource
        - rotation
        - size
- Organizing your game
    - The engine
        - run()
        - contains
            - scenes
            - subsystems
        - Publishes events
        - Everything under the engine responds to events
    - Subsystems
        - pluggable features
        - rendering
        - hardware events
    - Scenes
        - what scenes are
            - A piece of a game
            - containers
        - How the engine manages them
    - Sprites
        - data bags
        - Declarative
        - game objects
