- Transition
    - Enough about what ppb does for you. Let's talk about how to use this
      toolset.
- Events
    - Raising events
        - `signal(my_event)`
    - Creating new events
        - Dataclasses!
        - Just raise an instance of new class
    - Extending classes
        - `GameEngine.register(EventType, attribute_name, callable)`
        - on publish
            - Each attribute registered is called (without parameters)
            - The return value is set on the event
        - this can even be used to change default attributes (use caution!)
- Scenes
    - A stack
    - Commands from existing scenes (or subsystems)
        - StartScene - adds to the stack
        - StopScene - pops from the stack
        - ReplaceScene - pops, then adds to the stack
    - Lifetime messages
        - SceneStarted
        - ScenePaused
        - SceneContinued
        - SceneStopped
- Sprites
    - Behaviors
        - update pattern
        - event handlers
        - Add additional events to trigger decision trees or behavior trees
    - Coordination
        - Sprites can spawn other sprites.
            - pass one to another via parameter
        - Using types
            - All events have the current scene attached
            - `get(kind=type)`
        - Using tags
            - `scene.add(my_sprite, tags=["danger"])`
            - `scene.get(tag="danger")`
        - Using messaging
            - Every handlers accepts a signal function
            - `signal(my_event)`
- The Camera
    - Subclassing to add event handlers
    - Zoom?
    - Screen shake (Just kidding)
- Subsystems
    - How they work
        - An idle event
    - What you can do with them
        - Acheivement systems
        - Scoring systems
        - Save system
